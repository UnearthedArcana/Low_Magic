<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #100: No Generic Magic Items</i></b></p>
    <p>This component aims to reduce the amount and influence of magic items that are barfed all over the world.</p>
    <p>Part of this is just for show: it removes the fourth-wall-breaking "+1," "+2," etc. from item names.  Also, it de-enchants almost all "generic" magical equipment and standardizes the enchantment levels of weapons for purposes of which enemies they can hit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> ALL generic +1, +2, and +3 items become "Mastercraft" items, forged with unusual materials and skill but not actually enchanted.</li>
      <li> All named weapons that were formerly from +1 to +4, become +3 weapons for purposes of what they can hit - though their bonuses and magical abilities remain unchanged.</li>
      <li> All upgraded weapons and originally +5/+6 weapons become +5 for purposes of what they can hit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(This component does not work on IWDEE - too many items are defined and recognized by the "plus" in their names and descriptions.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the SCS component "Make +1 Weapons Into Fine Weapons." This component also has other effects, of course. You should not install that component of SCS if you want to use this component.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #200: No Spell Level Scaling</i></b></p>
    <p>This component limits the power of spellcasting, by removing level scaling is from all spells.  So Fireballs will only ever do 5d6 damage, DUHM will only ever add 1 point to your stats, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #300: Reduced Spell Durations</i></b></p>
    <p>This component further limits the power of spellcasting by reducing and standardizing all spell durations, to 3 rounds, 6 rounds, 2 turns, or 4 hours, depending on the duration of the original spell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #400: Increased Price of Magic Scrolls</i></b></p>
    <p>This component increases the price of scrolls.  Arcane scrolls that allow you to learn spells can either be 100 times the square of the spell level (so, 8,100gp for 9th level spells), or simply triple the vanilla scroll price.  Other scrolls will be triple the normal price.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #500: Reduced Power of Magic Wands</i></b></p>
    <p>This component </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #600: Slower XP Advancement for Fighters and Rogues</i></b></p>
    <p>Since this mod can pretty severely weaken spellcasters, relative to warriors, it makes sense that warriors should advance in poer more slowly.  This component puts fighters onto the paladin/ranger XP table, and puts thieves and bards onto the old fighter XP table.</p>
