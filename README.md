<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #1:</i></b></p>
    <p>This component aims to reduce the amount and influence of magic items that are barfed all over the world.</p>
    <p>Part of this is just for show: it removes the fourth-wall-breaking "+1," "+2," etc. from item names.  Also, it de-enchants almost all "generic" magical equipment and standardizes the enchantment levels of weapons for purposes of which enemies they can hit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> ALL generic +1, +2, and +3 items become "Mastercraft" items, forged with unusual materials and skill but not actually enchanted.</li>
      <li> All named weapons that were formerly from +1 to +4, become +3 weapons for purposes of what they can hit - though their bonuses and magical abilities remain unchanged.</li>
      <li> All upgraded weapons and originally +5/+6 weapons become +5 for purposes of what they can hit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(This component does not work on IWDEE - too many items are defined and recognized by the "plus" in their names and descriptions.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the SCS component "Make +1 Weapons Into Fine Weapons." This component also has other effects, of course. You should not install that component of SCS if you want to use this component.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p><b><i>Component #2:</i></b></p>
    <p>This component limits the power of spellcasting, in two key ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 1) Level scaling is removed from all spells.  So Fireballs will only ever do 5d6 damage, DUHM will only ever add 1 point to your stats, etc.</li>
      <li> 2) Spell durations are reduced and standardized to 3 rounds, 6 rounds, 2 turns, or 4 hours, depending on the duration of the original spell.</li>
    </ul>
